# AniSync (Fork)

A modified fork of AniSync, a native Android client for AniList.

## Key Additions & Differences from Original

### 1. Hidden / Ghost List System
- **How the Hidden Logic Works:**
  - When an anime or manga entry is marked with **"Hidden from status lists"** or set to **"Private"** on AniList (or in-app), AniSync classifies it as a ghost/hidden entry.
  - Ghost entries are filtered out from all regular library tabs (Watching, Completed, Planning, Paused, Dropped, Repeating) and general search results.
  - All hidden entries are collected into a dedicated **Hidden** tab in the Library.
- **Protection & Security:**
  - Protected with a built-in 4-digit numeric keypad with auto-unlock upon entering the correct PIN.
  - The hidden item count badge on the tab is hidden for privacy.
  - Whenever the app is reopened or restarted, the selected tab resets automatically to "All" so the hidden list is never left open or exposed.
 
> one flaw i found out that private + hide form list done so it became a ghost entry and doesn't appear anywhere in anilist except when you search, this was orginal logic for this but after many trial i found that anilist api drop such entries to make it appear it must be in a custom list so there it makes the whole logic fall apart if any suggestions anyone can tell
